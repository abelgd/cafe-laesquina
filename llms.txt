# Cafe Summary
Super Deutsch Kebab Hyper Shop is a highly specialized kebab establishment where every wrap defies logic, serving ultra-German kebabs with bratwurst, sauerkraut, and controlled chaos in a proudly confusing atmosphere.

> Founded “officially” sometime around 1789, the shop follows ancient, scientifically questionable kebab traditions approved by Uncle Günther and a very moody rotating grill.
